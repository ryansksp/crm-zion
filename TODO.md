# TODO: Fix JSX Syntax Errors in ClientesAtivos.tsx

- [x] Remove the premature closing `</div>` after the header section (around line 233) to keep the `space-y-6` div open for all content.
- [x] Move the success popup (`{showSuccessPopup && ...}`) outside the `filteredClientes.map` to the component level, placing it after the main content div.
- [x] Ensure all `div` elements in the client rendering section are properly closed, particularly in the details, grid, and alertas areas.
- [x] Verify the entire JSX return is wrapped in a single parent element (the `space-y-6` div).
- [x] Fix any remaining missing closing tags or parentheses at the end of the file.
- [x] Run TypeScript compiler or linter to confirm all errors are resolved.
- [ ] Test the component to ensure it renders correctly without runtime issues.
